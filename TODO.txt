For HashTable :

    ht=HashTable<K,V>
    keys=ht.getKeys()   should be an object that allows to loop over the keys with the syntax
                for (K k:keys)
    values=ht.getValues()     idem for the values.
            

For reading the configuration file
   
    We should memoize the terminal preferences in GitRepository.

TODO

- the purge vector is parsed too many times
- a better command line argument parser
- a better image for "plus.png"
- the installation program should read the configuration file an fill the blanks.
- in the installation, there is a duplicate of information between   BackupWidget::exclude_list and ExcludeChooser::choosers.
- make a version with no graphical interface. One should be able to do the backup even from the most basic debbootstraped USB stick.
- symlinks are ignored. That should be optional. See also the todo about printing the log file.
- include this TODO.txt in the manual.
- Before to exit the program, we should print the log file. Many "throws" could be silently catch during the execution and produce a warning in the log file.
    example : excluding a non-existing directory should be very clearly notified to the user.
- When one deletes a HashTable, it deletes the values. Is it a good choice ? That's what I need in my use case, but ...
