For HashTable :

    ht=HashTable<K,V>
    keys=ht.getKeys()   should be an object that allows to loop over the keys with the syntax
                for (K k:keys)
    values=ht.getValues()     idem for the values.
            

For reading the configuration file
   
    We should memoize the terminal preferences in GitRepository.

TODO

- the purge vector is parsed too many times
- a better command line argument parser
- a better image for "plus.png"
- the installation program should read the configuration file an fill the blanks.
- in the installation, there is a duplicate of information between   BackupWidget::exclude_list and ExcludeChooser::choosers.
- make a version with no graphical interface. One should be able to do the backup even from the most basic debbootstraped USB stick.
- symlinks are ignored. That should be optional.
