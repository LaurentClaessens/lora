A backup program.

Creates a copy of the home directory into a backup directory (typically on an encrypted external hard disk--to your own responsibility).

The main feature is : the backup copy is only a copy. You can browse it with your favorite file browser and get a file back with a simple copy. You do not require a special software for getting back your data.

Example. 
We backup the repertory  /home/daniel  into  /mnt/backup.

Typically /mnt/backup is the mount point of an encrypted external hard drive.


FIRST PASS (backup)

This software loops over the files and repertories of /home/daniel and creates a copy into
/mnt/backup/bakatot.lora

When making the backup of /home/daniel/bar/foo.txt,
* check if /mnt/backup/bakatot.lora/bar/foo.txt  exists
* if not, create it with a simple copy (but the last write time attribute is conserved)
* if /mnt/backup/bakatot.lora/bar/foo.txt exists,
    - move to /mnt/backup/bakapurge.lora/<today date>/<hour>/modified/bar/foo.txt   (keeping the time attribute)
    - make the copy.

Thus the backup is incremental in the sense that the old version of a modified files is still available in a directory whose name is the date and the hour of the backup.


The directories given in 'priority' are done first (if they are in the starting path), even if they are inside an excluded directory.


ATTENTION : There is no mechanism to suppress (really) old file. Thus the size of directory /mnt/backup is always increasing. This is by purpose : I prefer not have an automated way to suppress data.


SECOND PASS (purge)

Lora loops over the directory /mnt/backup/bakatot.lora and checks if these files correspond to files in /home/daniel.
When looking at /mnt/backup/bakatot.lora/blah/stuff.tex

* check if /home/daniel/blah/stuff.tex exists
 - if yes, do nothing
 - if not, assume that this file was removed in the home and then move
/mnt/backup/bakatot.lora/blah/stuff.tex ---> /mnt/backup/bakapurge.lora/<today date>/<hour>/removed/blah/stuff.tex


By the way, Lora has very bad performance against renaming an intere directory : in the first pass, it copy everything and in the second pass, it move the whole to the purge directory.
